### 1. `exp-1_classesAndObjects`
This experiment demonstrates the basics of defining and using classes and objects in Java. It covers:
- Defining a class with fields and methods.
- Creating objects and accessing their properties and methods.

### 2. `exp-2_ConstructorsDestructorsandOverloading`
This experiment illustrates:
- Constructors: Default and Parameterized constructors.
- Destructor-like behavior with the `finalize()` method.
- Method overloading: Creating multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

### 3. `exp-3_inheritance`
This experiment covers:
- Inheritance concepts: Creating base and derived classes.
- Method overriding using the `@Override` annotation to alter behavior in derived classes.
- Multilevel inheritance and polymorphism in action.

### 4. `exp-4_interface`
This experiment introduces Java interfaces, including:
- Defining and implementing interfaces.
- Polymorphic behavior using interfaces.
- Multiple interface implementation in a class.

### 5. `exp-5_packageAndImport`
This experiment demonstrates:
- Creating custom packages to organize Java classes.
- Importing classes from one package to another.

### 6. `exp-6_exceptionHandling`
This experiment showcases Java's exception handling mechanisms:
- Using `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions.
- The `finally` block to execute code regardless of exceptions.
- Handling multiple exceptions in a single block.

### 7. `exp-7_generics_Classesandmethods`
This experiment explains the use of generics:
- Generic classes to define types at runtime.
- Generic methods to handle different types of objects safely.

### 8. `exp-8_fileHandling4`
This experiment demonstrates:
- Reading from and writing to files using Java I/O.
- Handling file exceptions and understanding the importance of proper exception management in file operations.
